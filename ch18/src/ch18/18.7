What does the following code do
================================

public int myStery(int a, int b){
	if(b==1){
		return a;
	}else{
		return a + myStery(a, b - 1);
	}
}

Output
======
It depends on the value entered, if initial value is 1 then the method returns the value of a.
If the the initial value is not equal to 1, the value value adds a to its self b times until b ==1.
which is a product of 'a' and 'b'.
